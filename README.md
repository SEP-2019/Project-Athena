# Instructions

## 1)Install NodeJS
Proceed to install the LTS version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) which will include Npm (node package manager)

## 2) Installing the packages
Once node and Npm are installed, cd into Client and Backend and run the following in both directories
```
npm install
```

## 3) Run the server and the react project 
At the moment, react and the Express server are running in 2 different folders, to run either, execute the following commands
```
Backend:
npm start

Client:
npm start
or
nodemon start

```

Note: The react client will reload any changes automatically when you change files. Beware that for the backend, you will have to stop the server (ctrl c) and then npm start again
